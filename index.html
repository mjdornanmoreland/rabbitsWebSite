    <h3>Rabbits</h3>
    <p>Ideally, a rabbit should be given an hour of attention from its owner each day. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It eats hay and grass - most important part of diet Pellets.</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Foraging material</li>
        <li>Plants, herbs, weeds and flowers</li>
        <li>Fruit</li>
        <li>Treats</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Rabbits can be housed in hutches, cages, or pens.</p>

    <h3>Special Care for Fluffy Rabbits</h3>
    <p>Aside from the usual necessities of caring for your pet rabbit such as proper nutrition and sanitary bedding conditions, there are some special measures you must take to help keep your fluffy rabbit in peak health. If you’re thinking of getting a
        fluffy rabbit as a pet, you should be prepared to groom them almost daily. While you can get away with less in the case of Lionheads, leaving Angoras or Jersey Woolies ungroomed can lead to mats and skin infections.
    </p>
    <p>Consider whether you’ll be able to trim your fluffy rabbit’s fur on your own, or whether you’ll need professional help to keep them looking their best. Rabbits aren’t covered in most standard veterinary clinics or grooming parlors, meaning that you’ll
        need to find an exotic animal vet that will help you maintain their grooming.</p>
    <p>One of the most important habitat requirements is that your rabbit has more than enough space to live. It depends on how many available space you have but in general the rule applies, the more space the better. If either your budget and/or available
        space is limited you should at least try to assure that the size of the habitat is your rabbit’s length multiplied by 5. Moreover, it is recommended to have a minimum width of the rabbit’s length multiplied by 3. Regarding the minimum height,
        for a lionhead it is not essential to have a tall habitat. The only rule that applies is that he should be able to stand on his back legs without touching any surface.</p>
    <p>If your rabbit cage fits in your vehicle, your rabbit can travel this way, but most cages take up too much room and may allow your rabbit to hurt themselves if you have to stop or turn suddenly. Some people use small crates meant for dogs, but it
        can be awkward to get your rabbit in and out of at front-opening cage if they won't willingly hop in it. Instead, consider getting a travel carrier that opens on the top and sides. With this type, you can easily lift your rabbit in and out of
        the carrier. Additionally, the solid walls make it private for your rabbit to feel secure, rather than open to the elements like a dog crate would be. </p>
    <h3>GET YOUR RABBIT USED TO THEIR CARRIER</h3>
    <p>Allow your <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbit-care-guide-1239306">rabbit</a> to get used to the carrier before the car ride by following a few steps.1</p>
    <ol>
        <li> First, allow them to explore the carrier on their own. Place it on the floor during playtime and put a few favorite treats inside on top of a towel.</li>
        <li> After a while, gently put your rabbit in the carrier for a few minutes at a time with their favorite treat or toy.</li>
        <li> To get them adjusted to having to stay in the carrier, start out by placing your rabbit in their carrier on the blanket with the treats. Close the door securely and pick up the carrier making sure to keep it close to your body, not swinging by
            your side like a bucket.</li>
        <li> Walk around the house and hold the carrier on your lap for a few minutes.</li>
        <li> Eventually, work up to keeping your rabbit in the carrier for 30 minutes before letting them hop out on their own.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Cool the Car Before Traveling With Your Rabbit</h3>
    <p>Now that your rabbit is comfortable in their carrier, consider the temperature of the car before going on a real car ride. Rabbits do not tolerate temperatures over 75 degrees F. Therefore, you need to make sure they stay cool.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't allow the carrier to sit in direct sunlight in the car.1</li>
        <li>Never leave your rabbit unattended in the vehicle on a warm day</li>
        <li>Turn the air conditioning on, but don't allow the vents to blow directly onto your rabbit's carrier.</li>
        <li>• On a really hot day (or if you do not have air conditioning), place a damp towel over the carrier along with an ice pack wrapped in a small towel inside the carrier for added cooling. </li>
        <li>If it's the other extreme and cold outside, make sure the heat vents are not blowing directly onto the carrier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PRACTICE GOING ON A CAR RIDE</h3>
    <p>Once your rabbit is used to their carrier and the car is a safe temperature, place the carrier on the floor of your car or buckled into a seat. Start out taking short trips around the block and work up to longer trips of 30 minutes to an hour to acclimate
        your rabbit to both the carrier and the sensation of a moving vehicle.</p>

    <h3>Plan Ahead for the Car Ride</h3>
    <p>Now that your rabbit is ready to travel, you must make sure you don't forget to pack for them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Pack extra food that your rabbit normally eats, a water bottle that can attach to the carrier, and some favorite treats.2</li>
        <li>• Get a health certificate from your vet if you are crossing state lines or attending a rabbit event, and consider getting your rabbit microchipped in case they get away from you.</li>
        <li>• Pack some cleaning supplies like paper towels and a safe pet cleaner for any messes or spills. You can also place a blanket, trash bag, or cardboard piece over the seats in the car where the carrier will sit to protect from any stress-induced
            urine spraying or spills. Consider placing a puppy training pad on the bottom of the carrier for extra absorbency or if the carrier has room, a corner litter box.</li>
        <li>• Place some pellets and hay in the carrier for your car ride and offer the water bottle regularly for a few minutes every hour if it isn't attached to the carrier. If your bunny prefers, you can give him water in a dish during stops.</li>
        <li>• When you stop, offer your bunny their favorite treats as many rabbits don't eat much due to the stress of traveling.</li>
        <li>• If your trip is longer than a single day, pack an exercise pen to use as temporary overnight housing.</li>
        <li>• Only take your rabbit out of the carrier in enclosed spaces to prevent escapes. A stressed rabbit may dash away in a panic if they get out of their carrier outdoors.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>HOUSETRAINING</h3>
    <p>Rabbits are naturally very clean animals, and will not be happy or thrive in a dirty environment. Pick up after your rabbit regularly, and of course, make sure that their hutch, enclosure and foods bowls are all regularly cleaned and washed. Rabbits
        are relatively easy to litter train, and will usually go to the toilet in the same place every time. If the rabbit is already used to using a litter tray, you may find that simply placing the tray in the area of your choosing will be sufficient
        to encourage your pet to do his business in that spot. If your rabbit is not already house trained or used to using a litter tray, you will probably need to work by a process of trial and error, identifying the area of the hutch or room where
        your rabbit prefers to go to the toilet, and placing the litter tray there. Make sure that the litter you select is safe for your rabbit- paper based litters or those made of biodegradable materials are best. Do not use clay, clumping litters,
        scented litters or wood pellets, as your rabbit may try to eat them, which can be very dangerous.</p>

    <h3>RABBIT PROOFING THE HOME</h3>
    <p>While giving your rabbit free run of the house is one of the best things you can do for them in terms of supporting their exercise needs and giving them lots to do, this does of course mean that you will need to rabbit- proof the house or any rooms
        which they have access to, to protect both your pet and your furniture. Even if you intend for your rabbit to be loose in the house most of the time, you will still need to provide a hutch in a quiet corner for them to sleep in or escape to if
        you have guests or people around that might make your rabbit nervous, and to close them away safely within when needed. Rabbits are prolific chewers, and will chew furniture, curtains, electrical cords, shoes- more or less anything within their
        reach that they can sink their teeth into given the chance! You can buy cable tidies and plastic tubes to protect electrical cords within the home, and you should make sure that you cover or pack away any cords or electrical cables that your bunny
        might come across. Providing rabbit- safe toys and blocks for chewing on and making sure that your rabbit is not lonely and receives enough attention is vital in minimising the chances of your rabbit finding their own entertainment and grinding
        down their teeth on your possibly expensive and unsuitable furniture and knickknacks. Cardboard boxes, wooden blocks and hard balls all make good toys and play areas for rabbits.</p>
    <h3>THER PETS IN THE HOME</h3>
    <p>Generally, rabbits can live side by side with other household pets such as cats and dogs quite happily, provided that the other animal in question is well trained and does not view your rabbit as prey. Introduce other pets to your rabbit carefully
        and slowly, and make sure that your rabbit can always escape to safety if he is nervous. Some rabbits will play quite happily with other pets like dogs and puppies, but always supervise play, as dogs can sometimes be rather boisterous and could
        inadvertently hurt your rabbit. As with any animal, some pets get on better with company, particularly of other species, than others, and some animals just won't take to sharing their space and environment no matter how hard you try to encourage
        them.
    </p>
    <h3>GOING OUTSIDE</h3>
    <p>In the wild, rabbits graze grass as a large part of their diet, so if you can provide time and space for your house rabbit to be able to play outside safely in an enclosure, then all the better. If you are able to keep your rabbit as an indoor/ outdoor
        pet, then be mindful of the differences in temperature between the indoor and outdoor environment in order to avoid shocking your rabbit's system with extremes of heat and cold. Remember that rabbits housed indoors most of the time will be less
        hardy and resilient to the vagaries of the British weather, and will probably not develop the same thick winter coat which rabbits housed outdoors will have in the winter, so take care that your rabbit is not too cold when outside. Similarly in
        the summertime, make sure that your rabbit does not overheat, either in the house or when playing in the sun.</p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>If you are considering getting a house rabbit or bringing an existing rabbit to live indoors, there are a fair few bits and pieces you will need to have ready beforehand to make sure you've thought of everything. Use this checklist to make sure that
        you're fully prepared.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Suitably rabbit- proofed rooms</li>
        <li>Rabbit safe cat litter</li>
        <li>Flea comb</li>
        <li>A brush for the coat</li>
        <li>Rabbit- specific flea drops</li>
        <li>Food bowls</li>
        <li>Water bottles and a brush to clean them with</li>
        <li>Litter tray</li>
        <li>A scoop to pick up droppings</li>
        <li>Dustpan and brush</li>
        <li>Toys, chewing blocks and other forms of entertainme</li>
        <li>A small hand held vacuum cleaner</li>
        <li>Hay for grazing</li>
        <li>Rabbit muesli or food pellets</li>
        <li>Fresh vegetables</li>
        <li>Nail clippers</li>
        <li>A safe enclosure or pen that you can use indoors or outdoors</li>
        <li>A suitable hutch with a bedding area in it which your rabbit can access at all times</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CAN RABBITS AND CATS LIVE TOGETHER OR GET ALONG?</h3>
    <p>Yes. “Rabbits can get along with pet cats and dogs” [1] since they are social animals and will enjoy the company of other furry critters. However, another bun will be the best companion if well bonded since felines are more of solitary creatures.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, you need to ensure your cat does not have any predator tendencies or instincts. Otherwise, it may attack your bunnies. Again, note that not all bunnies will get along with other pets since they tend to have slightly different personalities.</p>
    <p>If you intend to let them socialize and live together, you need to introduce them to each other carefully since as prey animals, bunnies may tend to be very fearful. Therefore, they may be very stressed unless they feel safe while in their environment
        (or have a safe hiding place).</p>
    <p>Until you are certain that your cat cannot attack your rabbit, you should never leave them together unsupervised. Always be there at any time are together.</p>
    <p>Finally, groom them regularly including cutting your feline’s and bunny’s nails to minimize injuries in case a fight suddenly breaks out.</p>
    <h3>CAN RABBITS USE CAT LITTER?</h3>
    <p>Rabbits can use some cat litter but not all of them. Any clay litters may cause respiratory issues or digestive system problems if ingested. Also, some of them may have harmful ingredients.</p>
    <p>Secondly, those made from pine and cedar may be harmful to bunnies since they contain phenol which has been linked with liver disease in rabbits. If you use them, your bunnies will chew and ingest since chewing is one of their natural behaviors. Therefore,
        avoid those with pine and cedar shavings or pellets.</p>
    <h3>Brush your rabbit regularly</h3>
    <p>. Use a soft brush to run through your rabbit's fur to remove loose hairs as well as dirt and other debris. This will help keep your rabbit's coat looking shiny and new. Plus, rabbits love being brushed, so it can be pleasant bonding time with your
        pet.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>• After brushing, you may notice small tufts of fur sticking out of the coat. Go ahead and pull them out, your rabbit will not mind.</li>
        <li>• Rabbits will groom themselves regularly, though they cannot vomit like cats, so they are susceptible to hairballs if they swallow too much hair. Removing loose hairs will help prevent your rabbit from choking.[1]</li>
        <li>• Brush more frequently during shedding times, which occur about every 3 months.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Trim the rabbit's nails</h3>
    <p>Your rabbit's nails will keep growing, so check them once a week to see if they need trimming. They will probably need to be clipped about every month. Nails that are too long become uncomfortable for the rabbit, and can cause toe, nail, or foot injuries,
        or gait issues.[2]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>• You can do this on your own with a pair of rabbit nail clippers. Make sure your rabbit is lying on its back with the feet up so they are easy for you to get to, and gently clip the nails on one foot at a time. Make sure your rabbit is secure</li>
        so it can't kick or scurry away. Once you are finished, you can give your rabbit a treat as a reward.</li>
        <li>• When cutting, a good rule of thumb is to trim the nail to the same length as the fur. Hold up the rabbit's foot, and trim off the edge in one motion. You shouldn't cut a nail more than once.</li>
        <li>• If your rabbit has sensitive nails, and struggles some, lightly close the clippers on the area you wish to cut. If your rabbit reacts, move a little further down the nail and away from the skin.</li>
        <li>• It can be helpful to shine a light underneath the nail so you can see where you are cutting. You don't want to clip the blood vessel at the base of the nail.</li>
        <li>• Baby rabbits will have very sharp, but very small nails. These are probably best trimmed with a emery board instead of the full-size clippers.
    </ul>
    <h3>Clean your rabbit's eyes.</h3>
    <p>Watch your rabbit's eyes to keep an eye out for watery eyes or eye discharge. In addition to being a sign of other problems, discharge on your rabbit's cheeks can cause the skin there to become chafed and have the skin peel off. If you notice anything,
        a clean tissue should be enough wipe this away. Just be careful not to touch your rabbit's actual eye.[3] • If there is a lot of gunk, or it seems like your rabbit has a lot of tears, take </p>
    <ul>
        <li>• If there is a lot of gunk, or it seems like your rabbit has a lot of tears, take it to the vet to make sure there isn't a more serious problem.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Clean the ears</h3>
    <p>Check your rabbit's ears for waxy buildup. If you notice any, you can remove it by softly rubbing the ear with a cotton swab. Make sure you don't push the wax into the ear, and do not reach into the ear canal.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>• If you have a problem with wax in the ears, your vet may also recommend some wax removal products that you can apply.[4]</li>
        <li>• Make sure you use a cotton ball and not a smaller swab like a q-tip. If your bunny twitches or jumps during cleaning, you can accidentally push it into the ear, puncturing an eardrum and causing your rabbit to go deaf.[5]</li>
        <li>Clean out the scent glands</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>These are any rabbits’ top favorite actions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Digging,</li>
        <li>Chewing,</li>
        <li>Hiding</li>
        <li>Running through tunnels,</li>
        <li>Climbing,</li>
        <li>Flinging</li>
    </ol>
    <p>They prefer all these activities and they require these exercises to stay healthy and happy as well.</p>
    <p>So before you buy a rabbit toy consider any one or two of these above activities for your bunnies.</p>
    <p>These toys will allow your bunnies to play and at the same time participate in one or more of the activities a rabbit likes:</p>

    <h3>DO BUNNIES NEED CHEW TOYS?</h3>
    <p>Bunnies are a social animal and tend to get very bored very fast. To keep them entertained, a rabbit guardian must provide them with bunny chew toys.</p>

    <p>Just a heads up if your bunnies are not getting enough attention from you, they will really need some toys to play with. A lonely bunny will get stressed very fast.</p>

    <p>Bunnies mostly like to play with toys that allow them to chew on.</p>

    <p>The balls are harmless for your rabbits and edible. So you don’t have to worry about your rabbits chewing on it.</p>
    <p>It is a good exercise as well for your rabbits.</p>
    <p>Do not give your rabbits all three balls at the same time because they will dismantle all three of them in no time and will make a total mess of your house when they are indoors.</p>

        <h3>Types of Rabbit Bedding</h3>
        <p>If you’re wondering what type of bedding is best for rabbits, the truth is that there’s no easy answer to that question.</p>
        <p>There are several different bedding materials that offer a safe and comfortable environment for bunnies. Each option has its own pros and cons, so be sure to compare them before deciding on the best bedding for your pet.</p>
        <p>Safe rabbit bedding options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper bedding. Paper-based bedding is a widely available and popular bedding option. Known for its absorbency and odor control powers, and is often made from 100% recycled material. However, it’s typically more expensive than some other options.</li>
            <li>Fleece bedding. Reusable and machine-washable, fleece beds and liners are worth considering if you’re sick of regularly changing your bunny’s traditional bedding material. They’re free of dust and can help you save money over time, but the
                hassle of doing extra laundry is a turn-off for some.</li>
            <li>Pelleted straw bedding. Pelleted straw is non-toxic and safe for bunnies to ingest, and it does a good job of controlling odors. However, it’s not as absorbent as some other options.</li>
            <li>Hay bedding. Hay isn’t just an important part of your rabbit’s diet; it can also be an effective bedding material. Timothy hay provides a comfortable place for your rabbit to rest and enjoy nibbling on some food at the same time. The downside
                is that it’s not especially absorbent, so it needs to be changed fairly regularly.</li>
            <li>Aspen bedding. Aspen bedding for rabbits is generally considered to be the safest of the wood bedding options available as it doesn’t contain the toxic ingredients found in softwood shavings. Aspen is absorbent and good at controlling odors,
                but it’s not the cheapest bedding material available. </li>
            <li>Hemp bedding. A relatively new option, hemp is absorbent and affordable. However, it’s not as widely available as many of the other bedding materials on this list.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What to Look for When Choosing Rabbit Bedding</h3>
        <p>Make sure you consider the following factors when choosing bedding for your bunny.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Safety. The number-one concern for all rabbit lovers will no doubt be the safety of your pet. Look for bedding that is non-toxic, that doesn’t contain any harmful chemicals or additives, and that is free of dust. You should also make sure
                that the bedding won’t be dangerous for your pet if ingested.</li>
            <li>Comfort. Next, we all want our beautiful bunnies to be as comfortable as possible. The bedding you choose should be soft and cozy, and encourage burrowing and nesting behavior.</li>
            <li>Odor control. Check how effective the bedding is at eliminating odors, and how long it can keep your bunny’s cage smelling fresh. Don’t just take the manufacturer’s word for this — check out some independent customer reviews as well.</li>
            <li>Absorbency. The best bedding for rabbits will also be ultra-absorbent to quickly soak up any liquid. A clean and dry cage is essential for hygiene and health reasons, and the more absorbent the bedding is, the longer you’ll be able to go between
                bedding changes.</li>
            <li>Environmentally friendly. Finally, if you’re an eco-conscious pet owner, you may want to look for ways to reduce your bunny’s carbon pawprint when choosing their bedding. For example, you may want to look for natural bedding made from recycled
                materials and that is also completely biodegradable.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Rabbit Bedding Alternatives to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Before you start shopping for bunny bedding, please be aware that some bedding materials should be avoided at all costs. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Straw. While pelleted straw is OK to use, plain straw bedding for rabbits is simply unsafe and unsuitable. Not only does it lack absorbency, which poses major hygiene problems, but it also has stiff ends that could potentially injure your
                bunny’s eyes, face and paws.</li>
            <li>Pine and cedar. The use of cedar and pine bedding for rabbits is not recommended because they can affect the proper functioning of your rabbit’s liver. If you’ve got your heart set on using wood bedding, consider aspen instead.</li>
            <li>Cat litter. While cat litter is effective at controlling odors, it contains chemicals that are unsafe for bunnies.</li>
            <li>Corn husks. Not only do corn husks present the risk of mold growth, they can also cause blockages if ingested. As a result, they’re not a recommended bedding option.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions and answers</h3>

        <h3>WHAT IS THE BEST BEDDING FOR RABBITS?</h3>
        <p>There’s not one specific type of bedding that’s universally acknowledged as the best type of rabbit bedding. All bedding types have their own pros and cons, so it’s up to you to research the options before you buy.</p>
        <h3>CAN YOU USE SHREDDED PAPER FOR RABBIT BEDDING?</h3>
        <p>Shredded paper is sometimes used in conjunction with hay as a form of rabbit bedding. However, it’s not widely recommended due to the ink on the paper, which could potentially be harmful to your pet.</p>
        <h3>CAN I USE STRAW OR HAY FOR RABBIT BEDDING?</h3>
        <p>Straw is not recommended as rabbit bedding because it isn’t absorbent enough, and its stiff ends could cause injury to your pet. However, pelleted straw and hay are both safe bedding options.</p>
        <h3>HOW OFTEN SHOULD I CHANGE MY RABBIT’S BEDDING?</h3>
        <p>It varies depending on the bedding material you choose and how many rabbits you keep in the cage. However, as a general rule, it’s a good idea to thoroughly clean your pet’s cage and replace their bedding at least once a week</p>

        <h3>HOW MANY HOURS A DAY DO RABBITS SLEEP?</h3>
        <p>Rabbits sleep eight hours a day—but during the day as opposed to the night. Sometimes, when you witness this action from a bunny rabbit, it might literally seem like it has lost the strength in its body, dropping instantly to the ground. This
            is a kind of atonic condition that the body experiences.</p>
